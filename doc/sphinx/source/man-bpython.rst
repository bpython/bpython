bpython manual page
===================

Synopsis
--------

**bpython** [*options*] [*file* [*args*]]

**bpython-curses** [*options*] [*file* [*args*]]

**bpython-urwid** [*options*] [*file* [*args*]]


Description
-----------
The idea is to provide the user with all the features in-line, much like modern
IDEs, but in a simple, lightweight package that can be run in a terminal window.

In-line syntax highlighting.
    Highlights commands as you type!

Readline-like autocomplete with suggestions displayed as you type.
    Press tab to complete expressions when there's only one suggestion.

Expected parameter list.
    This displays a list of parameters for any function you call. It uses the
    inspect module, then tries pydoc.

Rewind.
    This is a bit misleading, but it code that has been entered is remembered,
    and when you Rewind, it pops the last line and re\-evaluates the entire
    code. This is error\-prone, and mostly useful for defining classes and
    functions.

Pastebin code/write to file.
    This posts the current buffer to a pastebin (bpaste.net) or writes it
    to a file.

Flush curses screen to stdout.
    Unlike other curses apps, bpython dumps the screen data to stdout when you
    quit, so you see what you've done in the buffer of your terminal.

Options
-------

The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.
If :program:`bpython` sees an argument it does not know, execution falls back to
the regular Python interpreter.

The following options are supported by all frontends:

--config=<config>      Use <config> instead of default config file.
-h, --help             Show the help message and exit.
-i, --interactive      Drop to bpython shell after running file instead of
                       exiting. The PYTHONSTARTUP file is not read.
-q, --quiet            Do not flush the output to stdout.
-V, --version          Print :program:`bpython`'s version and exit.
-l <level>, --log-level=<level>   Set logging level
-L <file>, --log-output=<file>    Set log output file

In addition to the above options, :program:`bpython` also supports the following
options:

-p file, --paste=file  Paste in the contents of a file at startup.

In addition to the common options, :program:`bpython-urwid` also supports the
following options if Twisted is available:

-r <reactor>, --reactor=<reactor>   Use Twisted's <reactor> instead of urwid's
                                    event loop.
--help-reactors                     Display a list of available Twisted
                                    reactors.
-p <plugin>, --plugin=<plugin>      Execute a :program:`twistd` plugin. Use
                                    :program:`twistd` to get a list of available
                                    plugins. Use -- to pass options to the
                                    plugin.
-s <port>, --server=<port>          Run an eval server on port <port>. This
                                    option forces the use of a Twisted reactor.
