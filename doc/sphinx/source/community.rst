Community
=========
Do you need help with using bpython? Do you want to thank the contributors
personally? Or maybe you want to help out, contribute some code or resources
or want to help in making bpython known to other persons?

These are the places where you can find us.

IRC
---
You can find us in `#bpython <irc://irc.freenode.net/bpython>`_ on the `Freenode
<http://freenode.net>`_ network. Don't worry when you get no response (this does
not usually happen) but we are all from Europe and when you get to the channel
during our nighttime you might have to wait a while for a response.

Mailing List
------------
We have a mailing list at `google groups
<http://groups.google.com/group/bpython>`_. You can post questions there and
releases are announced on the mailing list.

Website
-------
Our main website is http://bpython-interpreter.org/, our documentation can be
found at http://docs.bpython-interpreter.org/, and our pastebin can be found at
http://bpaste.net/.
