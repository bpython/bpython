Windows
=======
When bpython was developed it only supported Linux and we grew support for
other platforms as well.

There are no official binaries for bpython on Windows (though this is something
we plan on providing in the future).

The easiest way to get `bpython.cli` (the curses frontend running) is to install
an unofficial windows binary for pdcurses from:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses. After this you can just
`pip install bpython` and run bpython curses frontend like you would on a Linux
system (e.g. by typing `bpython-curses` on your prompt).
