Configuration
=============
There is a ``sample-config`` file supplied in your home directory. You can rename it
to ``config`` or copy it and make a new ``config`` file since bpython tries to
find ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bpython/config``(``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` defaults to ``~/.config`` if not set)
and use it as its configuration.

To edit the config file from ``bpython-curtsies``, press ``F3``.
