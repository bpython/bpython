Releases
========

Release schedule
----------------
bpython does not have a set release cycle. The developers will decide together
when the time is ripe to release a version. For information what happens after
the decision is made to make a release you should read the 'Release Path'
section.

Release Path
------------
After it is decided to release a new version of bpython the following checklist
is followed:

* The repository is frozen, nobody pushes until the version is built.

* Bob (:ref:`authors`) makes a tarball of the new version and sends it to Simon
  (:ref:`authors`) who will host it on the bpython website.

* The package is then downloaded by all of the people who like to test it.

* Everybody checks if there are no great problems:

  * Version numbers correct?

  * CHANGELOG is correct?

  * AUTHORS?

* After everybody says 'yes' the website and PyPI are updated to point to this
  new version.

  * Simon (:ref:`authors`) also checks if all numbers on the website have been
    updated.

* 24 hours later package maintainers could update their stuff.
