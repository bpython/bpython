"""For running Python code that could interrupt itself at any time in order to,
for example, ask for a read on stdin, or a write on stdout

The CodeRunner spawns a greenlet to run code in, and that code can suspend its
own execution to ask the main greenlet to refresh the display or get
information.

Greenlets are basically threads that can explicitly switch control to each
other.  You can replace the word "greenlet" with "thread" in these docs if that
makes more sense to you.

    After load_code() is called with the source code to be run,

    by calling request_from_main_greenlet.
    When this are called, the running source code cedes
    control, and the current run_code() method call returns.

    The return value of run_code() determines whether the method ought
    to be called again to complete execution of the source code.

    Once the screen refresh has occurred or the requested user input
    has been gathered, run_code() should be called again, passing in any
    requested user input. This continues until run_code returns Done.

    what it wants returned in the next run_code call - CodeRunner
