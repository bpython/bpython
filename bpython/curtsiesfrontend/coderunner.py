    As user code executes it can make requests for values or simply
    request that the screen be refreshed with `request_from_main_thread()`.
    This pauses the user code execution thread and wakes up the main thread,
    where run_code() returns whether user code has finished executing.
    This is cooperative multitasking: even though there are two threads,
    the main thread and the user code thread, the two threads work cede
    control to one another like like green threads with no parallelism.

    Once the screen refresh has occurred or the requested user input
    has been gathered, run_code() should be called again, passing in any
    requested user input. This continues until run_code returns True.

    The code thread is responsible for telling the main thread
    what it wants returned in the next run_code call - CodeRunner
    just passes whatever is passed in to run_code(for_code) to the
    code thread.
