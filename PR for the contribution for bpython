 using the ``exit()`` command or by pressing control-D like regular interactive
 Python.
 
+Installation via OS Package Manager
+-----------------------------------
+
+The majority of operating system of desktop computers comes with a package
+manager system, if you are any user of them, you can install ``bpython``
+using the package manager.
+
+Ubuntu/Debian
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Ubuntu/Debian family Linux users and install bpython using the apt package manager, using the
+command:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ sudo apt-get install bpython
+
+ArchLinux
+~~~~~~~~~
+Arch linux uses pacman as the default package manager, and you can use it to install bpython:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ pacman -S bpython
+
+
+Windows
+~~~~~~~
+**Caveats:** As ``bpython`` makes use of the ncurses library of \*nix-family operating systems,
+bpython on Windows is not officially supported and tested.
+
+However, you can still use bpython on Windows using a somewhat work around. Briefly, you should install
+these two packages using pip:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ pip install bpython windows-curses
+
+Then you should invoke a program called ``bpython-curses.exe`` instead of ``bpython.exe`` to use bpython:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ bpython-curses
+
+Mac OS
+~~~~~~
+Like Windows, Mac OS does not include a package manager by default. If you have installed any
+third-party pacakge manager like MacPorts, you can install it via
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ sudo port install py-bpython

+FAQ
+===
+**Q: Is bpython better than IPython**
+
+Generally bpython currently has less feature than IPython,
+however it is more convinient to use if you want to use it as a
+"better Python REPL" (much better than vanilla Python!)
+
+**Q: Can I contribute to the development?**
+
+Sure! Any kind of contribution, including development, bug issue, documentation improvement
+are welcomed!
+
+===============
+Troubleshooting
+===============
+**I get installation error**
+
+A: There are more than 1 way to install bpython, if you're experiencing error
+using pip or package manager, you can switch to another way to see if the problem
+is solved.
+
+**F1 key does not work**
+
+Some terminals caputure the F1 key as GUI function key, so you can disable it
+in terminal settings or use another terminal application.

 Alternatives
 ============
 
+Here are two alternatives to bpython:
+
 `ptpython`_
 
 `IPython`_
 
+Those two alternatives are very much similar to bpython,
+but in general since they provide more functionalities,
+they take more time to learn and configure, and more heavy weight than
+bpython.
+
+Bpython is very lightweight, and is very handy even you're using it for
+the first time.
+
 Feel free to get in touch if you know of any other alternatives that people
 may be interested to try.
